# System-Analysis-and-Design
**Patrick Valencia's Portfolio**

1) Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass Project, the client was Drive Pass and they wanted to make a system that would provide better driver training to their clientele with online classses, practice tests, and on the road training. 

2) What did you do particularly well?

What I did particularly well was the creation of the necessary diagrams. The activity diagram as well as the sequence diagram were very thought out and provide a in depth explination to anyone who looks at it.

3) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one aspect on these documents to revise, I would revise the Gantt chart in my businesss requirements document. I would improve it by providing a more descriptive key for what team was working on which part. Additionally the better clarification would go a long way in providing each team a better understanding of what they need to do.

4) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Its important to consider the user's needs when designing as in the end they're the ones that are gonna be using the product. If the product is not user friendly then there was no point in creating said product as the users won't even use it for its intened purpose. I interpreted the user's needs by placing myself in their shoes and thinking about how I would want the application to function and what needs to be done to make it work.

5) How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software in a very linear way. I make a plan, lay it out, and see what needs to be done. Once I have a general idea and plan to follow I just start working away. For future analyzations and designs, I will do my best to try and break them down into their simplest components and then go from there.
