# System-Analysis-and-Design
**Patrick Valencia's Portfolio**

1) Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass Project, the client was Drive Pass and they wanted to make a system that would provide better driver training to their clientele with online classses, practice tests, and on the road training. 

2) What did you do particularly well?

What I did particularly well was the creation of the necessary diagrams. The activity diagram as well as the sequence diagram were very thought out and provide a in depth explination to anyone who looks at it.

3) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one aspect on these documents to revise, I would revise the Gantt chart in my businesss requirements document. I would improve it by providing a more descriptive key for what team was working on which part. Additionally the better clarification would go a long way in providing each team a better understanding of what they need to do.

4) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
