**Patrick Valencia's Portfolio**

1) Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass Project, the client was Drive Pass and they wanted to make a system that would provide better driver training to their clientele with online classses, practice tests, and on the road training. 

2) What did you do particularly well?

What I did particularly well was the creation of the necessary diagrams. The activity diagram as well as the sequence diagram were very thought out and provide a in depth explination to anyone who looks at it.
